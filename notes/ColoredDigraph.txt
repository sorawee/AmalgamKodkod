ColoredDigraph example from modified Kodkod codebase
Observations. Aug 9th.

Global produces 1 (1 definite):

(edge[Node$1, Node$2])
	(!color[Node$1, Blue]) <<<UNFINISHED>>>
	((all n: one Node | (((n . color) = Red) <=> some (n . edge))){}) <<<UNFINISHED>>>
	(color[Node$1, Red]) <<<UNFINISHED>>>
	(Node[Node$1]) <<<UNFINISHED>>>
	(!edge[Node$1, Node$0]) <<<UNFINISHED>>>
	(!edge[Node$1, Node$1]) <<<UNFINISHED>>>

This is a bit large, but necessary. The !blue is there because this stage is
unaware that red and blue are disjoint. (Ask for explanation of !blue to find
that out.) Because Node1 is a Node, and red, and no other edges out, this edge
must exist.

Local with consequent compression gives us this same provenance.
Local WITHOUT consequent compression gives us this same provenance.
